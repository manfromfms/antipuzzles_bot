# antipuzzles_bot

This is a main repo of telegram bot with antichess puzzles. This project is currently in active development and hasn't yet achieved any stable versions.

Antipuzzles bot is meant to be used by a wide variety of users from different countries. Despite English language being the most used language on the internet, this project is oriented towards Russian users. One of these two languages has to be used when submitting code or opening new issues. In-code documentation has to be strictly written in English. Issues titles should include a translation into Russian or English, depending on what language is missing.
